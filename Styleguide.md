## Things I care about:

* always prefix *this* pointer when accessing member variables or methods of a class
* use [Allman-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indent_style&oldid=781009120#Allman_style) bracing and indentation
* also brace single line statements
* use camelcase for identifiers

## Things that are nice to have:

* have a free line when a "thought" of a code snipet got done
* UpperCamelCase for class identifiers, methods, const variables and non-autogenerated files
* else: lowerCamelCase
